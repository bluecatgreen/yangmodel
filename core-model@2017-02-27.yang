                        The FC switch represents and defines a protection switch structure encapsulated in the FC and essentially 'decorates' FCs that are involved in resilience schemes that use switching in a protection mechanism. 
                        Essentially FcSwitch performs one of the functions of the Protection Group in a traditional model. It associates 2 or more FcPorts each playing the role of a Protection Unit. 
                        One or more protection, i.e. standby/backup, FcPorts provide protection for one or more working (i.e. regular/main/preferred) FcPorts where either protection or working can feed one or more protected FcPort.
                        The switch may be used in revertive or non-revertive (symmetric) mode. When in revertive mode it may define a waitToRestore time.
                        It may be used in one of several modes including source switched, destination switched, source and destination switched etc. (covering cases such as 1+1 and 1:1).
                        It may be locked out (prevented from switching), force switched or manual switched.
                        It will indicate switch state and change of state.
                        The switch can be switched away from all sources such that it becomes open and hence two coordinated switches can both feed the same LTP so long as at least one of the two is switched away from all sources (is 'open').
